# PhotoAlbum
Photo album application for LeanTechniques.
To run this program, download and create a new Java project in eclipse named PhotoAlbum. Then within the PhotoAlbum project, create a package named PhotoAlbum. Add PhotoAlbum.java, OutputFormat.java, HTTPCall.java, HTTPHandler.java, and Tests.java to the project in the PhotoAlbum package. When running PhotoAlbum.java, the console will prompt for the number of the album you would like printed to the console. Enter a number and the program will print the respective photo ID's and Title's to the console. Some tests for an unreachable site require internet to be shut off. To test, run Tests.java, some tests use assertEquals, those that cannot use this describe what behavior should be observed in the console. All tests have descriptions.
