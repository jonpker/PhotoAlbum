# PhotoAlbum
Photo album application for LeanTechniques.
To run this program, download and create a new Java project in eclipse named PhotoAlbum. Add PhotoAlbum.java to the project in the default package. When running, the console will prompt for the number of the album you would like printed to the console. Enter a number and the program will print the respective photo ID's and Title's to the console. It is a functional program that displays the output in the desired human readable format without extra wrapping so it can be easily transmuted into a larger program for implementation.
